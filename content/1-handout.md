## The 5Ws Method of Evaluating Sources

#### Who? Authority
* Who is the author (individual, organization)?
* What are the author's qualifications (occupation, years of experience, position, education, other)?
* What is the author's institutional affiliation, if any? (educational institution, nonprofit organization, company, other)?
* Is contact information given so that you can contact the author for clarification or more information?
* Is there an About Us section?

#### What? Accuracy
* What is the purpose of the content?
* Does the content appear to be well-researched?
* Are there editors and fact checkers?  
* Are there references to sources of information supporting any statements made or viewpoints held?
* Are the facts documented so that you can verify the content in another source?
* Does the item include grammatical, spelling, or typographical errors?
* If Websites are suggested or linked to, are they quality sites?

#### When? Currency
* When was the item written or published?
* Is it important that the info you need  be right up to date?
* If a Website,
&nbsp;* When was the site created?
&nbsp;*	When was the content last updated?
&nbsp; *	Is it current enough for your needs?
&nbsp; *	Are there any "dead" links?

#### Where? Publisher
* Where is the content from?
* How reputable is the publisher?
* Does the publisher take responsibility for the content?
* Is the item published as a peer-reviewed/refereed journal, scholarly journal, magazine, or news source?
* If a Website,
 * Where is it published? What is the domain?  Learn more about Internet Domains.   
  * .com = a commercial site
  * .gov = a U.S. government site
  * .org = nonprofit organization site
  * .edu = an educational site
 * Will it be there tomorrow?  Is it a stable site that will continue to exist?

#### Why? Purpose & Objectivity
* Why does the source exist?
* Is there a statement of mission, purpose, target audience?
* Does it provide many opinions?  Is it balanced?
* Does it contain mostly opinions or facts?
* Is there bias in the information and opinions presented?
